This template for student thesis was created for the research group test, validation, and analysis of software intensive systems (TVA) at KIT with the intention to suite the requirements and quality standarts of the research group and KIT. 

The template was created in collaboration with our stundents, special thanks to them. 
The base of this template is the thesis template provided by ACCESS@KIT [[1]](https://de.overleaf.com/latex/templates/access-kit-thesis-vorlage/gcrjzsszvgtt), which was adapted and extended to suite the requirements of the TVA reseearch group. 
For the extensions we took inspiration from the thesis template created by the SoftVarE-Group [[2]](https://github.com/SoftVarE-Group/ThesisTemplate) of univeristy of Ulm. 

If you recognize anything that does not conform to the quality standards of KIT or TVA please feel free to change the template and contact a member of the TVA research group to change it permanently [[3]](https://tva.kastel.kit.edu/). 
The same applies to improvements and extensions that ease the use of this template. 

The template was created on [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) and is therefore only tested to compile on this platform. If you encounter problems to compile the template localy, please fix them your self and provide a report to a member of the TVA research group.
