This template for student thesis was created for the research group test, validation, and analysis of software-intensive systems (TVA) at KIT with the intention to suit the requirements and quality standards of the research group and KIT. 

The template was created in collaboration with our students, special thanks to them. 
The base of this template is the thesis template provided by ACCESS@KIT [[1]](https://de.overleaf.com/latex/templates/access-kit-thesis-vorlage/gcrjzsszvgtt), which was adapted and extended to suite the requirements of the TVA research group. 
For the extensions, we took inspiration from the thesis template created by the SoftVarE-Group [[2]](https://github.com/SoftVarE-Group/ThesisTemplate) of the University of Ulm. 

If you recognize anything that does not conform to the quality standards of KIT or TVA, please feel free to change the template and contact a member of the TVA research group to change it permanently [[3]](https://tva.kastel.kit.edu/). 
The same applies to improvements and extensions that ease the use of this template. 

The template was created on [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) and is therefore only tested to compile on this platform. If you encounter problems compiling the template locally, please fix them yourself and provide a report to a member of the TVA research group.
